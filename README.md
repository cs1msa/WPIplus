# WPIplus
Code, tools and other data resources extending the WPI Patent Test Collection to make it more suitable for patent research experimentation.

The WPI+ resource is an extension of the WPI collection. We extend it in several ways including:
1.	Definition of several verticals (i.e. defined subsets of the collection) and a method to create new verticals (subsets) in the future.
2.	Provision of ground truth for various tasks, including topics for prior-art retrieval.
3.	Python notebooks with code and data usage examples demonstrating ML/DL methods and their application to WPI+ verticals.
4.	Code for analyzing the collection and collection statistics.
For details see each of the main folders.
