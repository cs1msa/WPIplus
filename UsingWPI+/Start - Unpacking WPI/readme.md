# Step 1: Download the WPI Collection 
Access the WPI Collection in Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/1489994 and request access.

# Step 2: Unpack the WPI Collection
Use this code, named [7z Files Extraction and Organization by Vertical](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/blob/main/Collection%20Verticals%20(subsets)/Source%20Code/7z%20Files%20Extraction%20and%20Organization%20by%20Vertical.ipynb), to unzip the WPI Collection.

# Step 3: Start parsing the files of a Vertical or all Verticals
Adapt this code, named [CLTS Training Dataset Creation](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/blob/main/UsingWPI%2B/An%20example%20of%20a%20classification%20experiment%20workflow/Source%20Code/CLTS%20Training%20Dataset%20Creation.ipynb), to parse one or more vericals and create a training dataset. The provided code has been used to create training datasets corresponding to classification test sets (CLTS) by retrieving and structuring patent data from the WPI collection while filtering out the patetns included in the CLTS.
