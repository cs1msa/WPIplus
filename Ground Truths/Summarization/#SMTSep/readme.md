# Summarization Test Sets for EP Core Vertical 

## [#SMTSep{filter: B, all, 20151001}](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/tree/main/Ground%20Truths/Summarization/%23SMTSep/%23SMTSep%7Bfilter:%20B,%20all,%2020151001%7D)
We demonstrate the proposed methodology by constructing summarization test sets for the EP vertical. The test set is referred to as #SMTSep{filter: B, all, 20151001}, where the filter parameters specify that only B kind code patents, having complete textual fields and submitted after October 1, 2015 are included.
