# Classification Test Sets for EP Core Vertical 

## \[#CLTSep-ipcr{filter: B, all, 20151001}](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/tree/main/Ground%20Truths/Classification/%23CLTSep/%23CLTSep-ipcr%7Bfilter%3A%20B%2C%20all%2C%2020151001%7D)
We demonstrate the proposed methodology by constructing classification test sets for the EP vertical using the IPCR classification scheme. The test set is referred to as #CLTSep-ipcr{filter: B, all, 20151001}, where the filter parameters specify that only B kind code patents, having complete textual fields and submitted after October 1, 2015 are included. 

## \[#CLTSep-cpc{filter: B, all, 20151001}](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/tree/main/Ground%20Truths/Classification/%23CLTSep/%23CLTSep-cpc%7Bfilter%3A%20B%2C%20all%2C%2020151001%7D)
Similarly, the same methodology has been applied to create the test set #CLTSep-cpc{filter: B, all, 20151001}, using the CPC classification scheme. This demonstrates the flexibility of the methodology for constructing test sets across different verticals and classification schemes.
