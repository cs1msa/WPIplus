# Classification Test Sets for EP Core Vertical 
We demonstrate the proposed methodology by constructing classification test sets for the EP vertical using the IPCR classification scheme. The test set is referred to as #CLTSep-ipcr{filter: B, all, 20151001}, where the filter parameters specify that only B kind code patents, having complete textual fields and submitted after October 1, 2015 are included. Similarly, the same methodology has been applied to create the test set #CLTSep-cpc{filter: B, all, 20151001}, using the CPC classification scheme. This demonstrates the flexibility of the methodology for constructing test sets across different verticals and classification schemes.
