# Source Code Organization
This folder contains scripts that assist in the creation of classification test sets for the WPI dataset. These scripts help process the dataset and organize it into test sets according to specific classification schemes, ensuring the selection of relevant patents based on predefined criteria. They facilitate the construction of test sets for various verticals, enabling thorough and representative classification analysis.

## Classification Test Set Creation for Core Verticals
- [Classification Test Set Creation](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/blob/main/Ground%20Truths/Classification/Source%20Code/Classification%20Test%20Set%20Creation.ipynb): This script generates classification test sets (i.e., ground truth) based on specific criteria, using a CSV file that contains essential data for analyzing patent documents within a specific core vertical (e.g., EP).
