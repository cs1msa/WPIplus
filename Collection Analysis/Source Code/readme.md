# Source Code Organization
This folder contains scripts for both the entire collection and specific verticals. These scripts have been used to generate analyses results for the respective verticals.

## Plot Creation
### Core Verticals
- [Core Verticals - Plot the distribution of patent documents per kind code](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/blob/main/Collection%20Analysis/Source%20Code/Plot%20the%20distribution%20of%20patent%20documents%20per%20kind%20code.ipynb): This script generates the plot of the number of patent documents per kind code. 
- [Core Verticals - Plot the distribution of patents per section label](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/blob/main/Collection%20Analysis/Source%20Code/Plot%20the%20distribution%20of%20patents%20per%20section%20label.ipynb): This script generates the plot of the number of single patents per section label (IPCR and CPC).
 
## CSV File Creation
### Core Verticals
