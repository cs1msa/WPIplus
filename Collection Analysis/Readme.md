# Collection Analysis Oranization

This folder contains the analysis of the WPI collection and its various verticals. Specifically, it includes scripts, statistical analyses, NLP insights, and other relevant results derived from patent documents within each vertical. The analyses provide valuable insights into the specific characteristics, trends, and patterns present in the data.

These analyses will assist in:

1. Understanding the data structure and classification of patents.
2. Identifying trends and patterns in patent filings across different verticals.
3. Enabling more informed decision-making based on vertical-specific data.

Ultimately, this folder serves as a resource for in-depth exploration of the WPI dataset, supporting a better understanding of its verticals and facilitating further research and analysis.

## [Vertical Name] 
Under each vertical's name, you will find the gathered analysis specific to that vertical. This includes detailed statistical, NLP, and other analytical results derived from patent documents within that vertical. 

## Source Code
Under the source code folder, you will find scripts specifically designed for generating the analysis for all verticals. These scripts facilitate the processing and analysis of patent documents across different verticals, providing a consistent approach for statistical, NLP, and other types of analysis. They serve as the foundation for conducting vertical-specific analysis and generating insights across the entire collection.
