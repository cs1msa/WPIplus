Verticals. 
An important notion for using a large test collection such as WPI is that of a vertical. 
It is very unlikely that all documents in the WPI will be used for a single research experiment. 
Usually, different subsets of the collection are used depending on the task and the method to be evaluated. 
For example, cross-lingual research will typically use patents in multiple languages, while other tasks may require only a single language subset. The misuse of a subset is a very common source for comparability or reproducibility problems. To address this issue, in WPI+ we define verticals in a systematic and explicit way. First, each vertical takes a hash-code and a codename, so it can explicitly defined and referenced. This seems as a very simple or even na√Øve step, however as we have experienced in our research but also presented in the examples in Section 1, explicit naming is already a useful step and a good practice for better experimentation. Additionally, besides the textual definition, for every vertical we list all of its members (patents, or other patent documents) on the GitHub repository. Using this simple approach, there is absolutely no room for errors like those we described in the previous paragraph. We plan to use this method for every vertical that will be used in the future.
