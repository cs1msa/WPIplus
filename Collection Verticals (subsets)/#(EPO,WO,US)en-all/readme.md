# ðŸ“˜ #(EPO,WO,US)en-all Vertical

The `#(EPO,WO,US)en-all` vertical was developed to support **prior-art search tasks** and other IR/NLP experiments requiring high-quality, complete patent texts. This vertical includes **only patent documents that contain all three core textual sectionsâ€”`abstract`, `description`, and `claims`â€”in English**. This filtering ensures a consistent and reliable dataset, closely reflecting real-world scenarios where complete texts are needed for indexing, retrieval, and analysis.

To reduce ambiguity and the risk of duplicate representation, only **one full-text document per patent** is included. Although the initial process identified 1,804,870 patent documents, the final vertical contains **1,803,293 unique patents** from the US, EP, and WO offices, each represented by a single, complete document.
