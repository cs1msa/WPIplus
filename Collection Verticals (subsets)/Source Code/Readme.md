## Source Code Organization
This folder contains code for both the entire collection and specific verticals.

### #SC_VerticalAll
The two main scripts that can be applied to the entire collection or any vertical are the following:
- [7z Files Extraction and Organization by Vertical](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/blob/main/Collection%20Verticals%20(subsets)/Source%20Code/SC_VerticalAll/7z%20Files%20Extraction%20and%20Organization%20by%20Vertical.ipynb): This code extracts 7z files from the origin path into separate folders (EP, WO, US, CN, JP and KR) within the destination folder
- [CSV File Creation for Patent Document Analysis](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/blob/main/Collection%20Verticals%20(subsets)/Source%20Code/SC_VerticalAll/CSV%20File%20Creation%20for%20Patent%20Document%20Analysis.ipynb): This script generates a CSV file containing essential data for analyzing patent documents from the WPI dataset.
