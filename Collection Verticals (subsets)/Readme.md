# Collection Verticals Organization 
## Core Verticals \#EP, \#WO, \#US, \#CH, \#KR, \#JP
These are the core verticals containing all the patent files included in the WPI collection.
## "All English Text" Vertical \#(EP,WO,US)en-all
This vertical contains all the patent documents that have all their primary text fields (abstract, description, claims) in the English language. 
## Virtual Patent EP Vertical \#VPep
This vertical contains the virtual patents of the #EP vertical that have been created by merging the most updated information about a single patent that normally exists in different patent documents having various kind codes (e.g. A1, A2, B1, B2). 
## "All English Text" Virtual Patent Vertical for classification \#VP(ep,wo,us)en-all-labels (Representative sample) 
This vertical contains all virtual patents with complete English-language content in the abstract, description, and claims sections. Additionally, only patents with non-empty classification labels are included, and under-represented labels (with fewer than 20 occurrences) have been filtered out. A stratified sampling strategy was applied, retaining 5% of the instances per label (with a minimum of one per label), resulting in a representative yet balanced subset of the original dataset.

# What are Virtual Patents?
A Virtual Patent (VP) is a document that merges the most updated information about a single patent that normally exists in different patent documents having various kind codes (e.g. A1, A2, B1, B2). Working with the most up-to-date information about a patent often necessitates merging data from multiple documents, as more recent patent publications may only contain amended or updated sections rather than the complete patent document. Figure below shows an example of how a VP representing a single patent is produced in WPI+ by merging fields from different patent files.
