# Collection Verticals Organization 
## [Core Verticals \#EP, \#WO, \#US, \#CH, \#KR, \#JP](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/tree/main/Collection%20Verticals%20(subsets)/Core%20Verticals%20%23EP%2C%20%23WO%2C%20%23US%2C%20%23CH%2C%20%23KR%2C%20%23JP)
These are the core verticals containing all the patent files included in the WPI collection.
## ["All English Text" Vertical Created For Prior-Art Search Tasks \#(EP,WO,US)en-all](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/tree/main/Collection%20Verticals%20(subsets)/%23(EPO%2CWO%2CUS)en-all%20-%20Created%20for%20Priot-Art%20Search%20Tasks)
This vertical contains all the patent documents that have all their primary text fields (abstract, description, claims) in the English language.
### ["All English text" Sample Subset Vertical\#](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/tree/main/Collection%20Verticals%20(subsets)/%23Sample(EPO%2CWO%2CUS)en-all%20-%20Created%20for%20Priot-Art%20Search%20Tasks)
This vertical is a 60K sample subset of the #(EP,WO,US)en-all vertical.
## [Stratified Sample of #EP, # WO and #US Verticals Created For Classification Tasks\#](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/tree/main/Collection%20Verticals%20(subsets)/%23StratifiedSample(EPO%2CWO%2CUS)en-all%20-%20Created%20for%20Classification%20Tasks)
This vertical contains two representative, stratified sample datasets derived from the core #EP, #WO, and #US verticals.
## [Virtual Patent EP Vertical \#VPep](https://github.com/cs1msa/WPIplus/tree/main/Collection%20Verticals%20(subsets)/%23VPep)
This vertical contains the virtual patents of the #EP vertical that have been created by merging the most updated information about a single patent that normally exists in different patent documents having various kind codes (e.g. A1, A2, B1, B2). 

# What are Virtual Patents?
A Virtual Patent (VP) is a document that merges the most updated information about a single patent that normally exists in different patent documents having various kind codes (e.g. A1, A2, B1, B2). Working with the most up-to-date information about a patent often necessitates merging data from multiple documents, as more recent patent publications may only contain amended or updated sections rather than the complete patent document. Figure below shows an example of how a VP representing a single patent is produced in WPI+ by merging fields from different patent files.
